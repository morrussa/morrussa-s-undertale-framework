Why did you choose it?

1.High performance.the framework itself with Maximum CPU usage of 0.3% (My CPU has a single core occupancy of 5%,cpuz singel core score is 380)

2.Eazy to edit.I didn't waste time on the cumbersome UI system. The battle box was created by 6 Active, but I used some tricks to make it almost identical to the surface battle box

3.High configurable, with most configuration and talk files placed in a list, the entire reading process is easy to understand and not hard coded

4.High compatible with Android,i used Minimize the number of extensions as much as possible

5.Multiple enemies support.thats because ive played Octopath Traveler1&2 and...从加尔戴拉的肉体里出现了亡者，亡者在阻挡攻击！Ok I'm just encouraging you to do fewer linear processes

What did you need?

1.Understanding of ECS system instead of OOP

2.Respecting the principle of Occam's Razor
